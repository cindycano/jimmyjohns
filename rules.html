			<h1 class="emp">Rules for Employment</h1>

			<h2>Signed individiually during Paycore onboarding</h2>

			<h3>All employees of Brumfield Enterprises or ABC&M Services must comply with the following rules to the extent applicable to such employee's assigned duties at any given time. Failure to comply with any of these items may result in disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination of employment.
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				1. Jimmy John’s Number One “Golden Rule” IF YOU AGREE TO DO SOMETHING AT A CERTAIN TIME OR ON A CERTAIN DATE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT OR FIND THE COMPANY MAY BE BETTER OFF IF YOU DO IT DIFFERENTLY – CALL YOUR BOSS FIRST BEFORE YOU DO IT! IF YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE DEAL, THEN YOU HAVE TO CALL THE PERSON THAT DELEGATED TO YOU THAT JOB AND LET THEM KNOW. NO SURPRISES! NO EXCEPTIONS!
			</p>
			<p>
			2. Cash payouts require written authorization beforehand.  This can be in the form of text or email.  Verbal authorization is not allowed, and you will be held responsible for removing cash from the drawer without authorization.
			</p>
			<p>3. Delivery and in-shop orders are to be taken up to 10 minutes after posted closing time.
			</p>
			<p>
			4. No subs to anybody without coupon or payment.</p>
			<p>5. No exchanging of meats, (i.e. turkey for ham, or cheese for tuna, etc.)
Never provide any veggies or sauce on a slim – EVER!</p>
			<p>
			6. No beverage containers, (i.e. soda bottles, insulated coolers, etc.) are to be filled from the Coke machine or water cooler by an employee, customer or friend. Upon leaving your shift beverages must be discarded or taken with the employee. No beverages are to be visible at any time unless you are physically drinking from it or placing it back in the cooler.
		</p>
		<p>7. All delivery sandwiches are to be bagged by the manager or a designated employee, and delivery tickets must be pulled off by a manager or a designated employee only.</p>
		<p>8. When bread is done, you must serve customers that come into the store.  The lights need to be turned on, the door unlocked, and Jimmy Tunes needs to be playing.</p>
		<p>9. If you are late, you MUST call or text prior to your scheduled arrival time. Exceptions will be made to this policy when required by applicable law. If you do not call and do not report for your shift, you may be considered a no-call/no-show and your employment may end due to your voluntary job abandonment, subject to legally-protected exceptions.</p>
		<p>10. Employees who are experiencing symptoms of contagious illness, are exhibiting vomiting and/or diarrhea, have a sore throat and fever, or infected cuts or lesions (the latter only if you work directly with food) should not report for work. However, you must find a replacement for your shift, or ensure that your duties will be covered in your absence, unless requiring a replacement is prohibited by law. You must report such absences to your manager or direct report no later than two hours prior to the start of your scheduled shift or usual start time. You may be asked to provide a doctor’s note excusing your absence. Additionally, employees who work directly with food and have been diagnosed with any of the following illnesses must disclose such diagnosis to their direct report prior to hire or as soon as possible after diagnosis: Norovirus, Typhoid Fever (Salmonella Typhi), Shigellosis, E. Coli 0157:H7, and/or Hepatitis A.</p>
		<p>11. Every employee must use the mayo portioner. NO EXCEPTIONS!</p>
		<p>12. NO food trades, (i.e. Domino’s pizza for subs). No acceptance of free products from outside vendors is allowed.</p>
		<p>13. Employees and Managers who work a full 8-hour shift are entitled to a complimentary 8 inch sandwich. You may add 1 portion of cheese or avocado (but not both) if the sandwich does not have this by default. The meal must be consumed during your break during your shift. You may only ring up what you actually consume for your meal – ringing up additional items that are not consumed could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
		<p>14. At any time you may purchase with an employee discount.  Your order must be rung up by someone other than you, while you remain on the customer side of the counter as an employee other than you makes your sandwich</p>
		<p>15. Any food from outside vendors must be purchased before your shift begins.</p>
		<p>16. No meals are to be consumed at the office desk.</p>
		<p>17. No employee meals are to be purchased or consumed between the hours of 11:00 am and 1:00 pm, unless you are legally required to take a meal period within that time. No employee food can be consumed before the opening procedures are completed entirely.</p>
		<p>18. All employees must adhere to the Jimmy John’s Personal Grooming and Uniform Dress Code.</p>
		<p>19. All employees must abide by the Smoking Policy</p>
		<p>20. NO ALCOHOL allowed in the store. No employee is allowed to drink any alcohol within 4 hours prior to the start of their shift.</p>
		<p>21. The use of menus, bags or any other JJ branded material for notes (or any purpose except the item’s intended purpose) will not be tolerated.</p>
		<p>22. No reading of books, newspapers, etc. is allowed in customer view in the restaurant at any time, unless on a break.</p>
		<p>23. When selling day-old bread, we do not provide mayo or mustard. NO EXCEPTIONS!</p>
		<p>24. Do not give out or make change for anyone. Do not give cash back on credit/debit cards. We are not the bank – NO EXCEPTIONS!</p>
		<p>25. Cell phones are to be used for work-related use only.</p>
		<p>26. Delivery drivers may not carry more than $50 on their person at any time. When a driver’s cash exceeds $50 (including the $20 bank), the driver must drop all cash in excess of $50 into the register.</p>
		<p>27. Employees must be over the age of 18 to operate the meat slicer</p>
		<p>28. Employees must be over the age of 16 to use the bread knife.</p>
		<p>29. Employees are strongly discouraged from having sexual and/or romantic relationships with any other employee of any other Brumfield Enterprises nor ABC&M Services.  If a relationship does evolve over time, both parties must inform their supervisor. One or both parties of the relationship may be asked to change their work schedule, work location, or department.</p>
